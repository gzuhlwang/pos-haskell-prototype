Cardano SL (SL stands for "Settlement Layer") is a cryptographic
currency designed and developed by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/team). You can
think of this product as of Bitcoin reimagined in modern days. For those
who don't know what Bitcoin is, in the next section we'll talk a little
bit about what a cryptocurrency is and why do cryptocurrencies matter.
If you have basic understanding of Bitcoin, you may [skip]() the next
section. If you're eager to start working with Cardano SL, refer to
[Installation Guide]() and [Wallet Operation Guide]() to get started.

## Cryptocurrency Basics

[//]: # (@any)

Before giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let's first talk about
why do we care about digital currencies in general and cryptographic
currencies in particular. 

### Speed

As opposed to conventional (also called fiat), centrally banked
currencies such as Yen or American Dollar, digital currencies don't
require banking system to move value. Lack of this requirement means
that work with digital currencies is way faster than work with banking,
especially on the global scale. If we want to send ten Dollars from
Osaka to Denver using a digital currency, we won't have to wait for days
for the value to get transferred. In fact, there is no distinction
between sending value to your neighbour or to a friend on the other
side of the globe, the transfer will happen following the same
understandable rules within a predictable amount of time.

### You Own Your Money

With banking system, all that an owner of a bank account has is a
promise of a commercial bank to pay the person a certain amount of money
within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a payout request. Of
course, banks also have limits to such transactions, so nobody can "cash
out" quickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a
special kind of information, called _a secret key_ can spend the money
at will. No other entity has a power to manipulate value that a user
has.

### Pseudonymity

One can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they like, receiving
and spending money from different addresses in different ways. A
merchant running an E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses to
receive money and issue refunds and a personal "wallet" for their own
needs. All of this is controlled from one interface and there is no need
to log in to several payment platforms, suffering an overhead.

### Security

Your money are as secure as the _secret key_ that allows spending those.
That means that storing your secret key in a safe on a laptop
disconnected from the Internet is equivalent of having banknotes in a
password-protected lock-box in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this
money even by carrying out a successful cyber-attack.

## What Makes Cardano SL Special

There are a lot of similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano
SL, but also there are quite some differences between those two
cryptocurrencies. Most significant difference between Bitcoin and
Cardano SL is that Bitcoin is a Proof of Work type cryptocurrency, while
Cardano SL makes use of a Proof of Stake approach to consensus.

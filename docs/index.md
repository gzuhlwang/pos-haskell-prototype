Cardano SL (SL stands for "Settlement Layer") is a cryptographic
currency designed and developed by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/team). You can
think of this product as of Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix
design flaws of Bitcoin. For those
who don't know what Bitcoin is, in the [next
section](#cryptocurrency-basics) we'll talk a little
bit about what a cryptocurrency is and why do cryptocurrencies matter.
If you have basic understanding of Bitcoin, you may

[Installation Guide]() and [Wallet Operation Guide]() to get started.

## Cryptocurrency Basics

[//]: # (@any)

Before giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let's first talk about
why do we care about digital currencies in general and cryptographic
currencies in particular. 

### Why Do We Care?

#### Speed

As opposed to conventional (also called fiat), centrally banked
currencies such as Yen or American Dollar, digital currencies don't
require banking system to move value. Lack of this requirement means
that work with digital currencies is way faster than work with banking,
especially on the global scale. If we want to send ten Dollars from
Osaka to Denver using a digital currency, we won't have to wait for days
for the value to get transferred. In fact, there is no distinction
between sending value to your neighbour or to a friend on the other
side of the globe, the transfer will follow the same
understandable rules within a predictable amount of time.

#### You Own Your Money

With banking system, all that an owner of a bank account has is a
promise of a commercial bank to pay the person a certain amount of money
within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a payout request. Of
course, banks also have limits to such transactions, so nobody can "cash
out" quickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a
special kind of information, called _a secret key_ can spend the money
at will. No other entity has a power to manipulate value that a user
has.

#### Pseudonymity

One can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they like, receiving
and spending money from different addresses in different ways. A
merchant running an E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses to
receive money and issue refunds and a personal "wallet" for their own
needs. All of this is controlled from one interface and there is no need
to log in to several payment platforms, suffering an overhead.

#### Security

Your money are as secure as the _secret key_ that allows spending those.
That means that storing your secret key in a safe on a laptop
disconnected from the Internet is equivalent of having banknotes in a
password-protected lock-box in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this
money even by carrying out a successful cyber-attack.

#### Extensibility

Using an approach known as [_side chains_](), general-purpose
cryptocurrencies (such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin) can "fuel"
domain-specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way,
whatever innovative thing is developed via a domain-specific
cryptocurrency, anyone who holds value in a general-purpose
cryptocurrency can participate in. Examples of such applications are
identity management, gaming and gambling, verifiable computations.

### What is a Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to
manipulate value. Cryptography provides us with a way to generate a
proof that it was us who issued any kind of information. This is called
_digital signing_. In cryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database
which answers a question "which address has how much money") by signing
and sending transactions into the network and receiving blocks of
confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are normally decentralized,
which means that many people from all over the globe participate in
ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Obviously, a
consensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most
significant approaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the
next section.

## What Makes Cardano SL Special?

[//]: # (v0.1.0.0)

There are a lot of similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano
SL, but also there are quite some differences between those two
cryptocurrencies. Most significant difference between Bitcoin and
Cardano SL is that Bitcoin is a Proof of Work type cryptocurrency, while
Cardano SL makes use of a Proof of Stake approach to consensus.

### Purpose of a Consensus Algorithm

Consensus algorithms are used to produce new blocks of transactions,
updating the state of the ledger as a result. Whenever someone publishes
a block of transactions, they (or rather, their node that runs a
cryptocurrency protocol) have to attach a proof that they had the right
to do it. Below we discuss two types of such proofs.

### Proof of Work and Mining

Proof of Work is the most common consensus algorithm type for
cryptocurrencies. It originated in Bitcoin and is the reason why this
currency works well. To generate a proof of work, a computer has to
solve a challenge. The challenge is a computationally-heavy problem
which is hard to solve, but simple to verify a solution to. When a
computer on a Proof of Work-based network finds a solution, it publishes
it, along with the transactions that given computer observed while
cracking the problem. The owner of this computer collects transaction
fees and reward for generating a block. This whole process is called
_mining_. Mining is very energy-consuming and the more competitive
mining gets, the more energy-consuming it is.

### Proof of Stake and Minting

Proof of Stake is a novel approach to block generation. IOHK scientists,
lead by [Prof. Aggelos Kiayias](https://iohk.io/team/aggelos-kiayias/)
have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called
Ouroboros. Ouroboros lies at the heart of Cardano SL. Research team has
published a
[whitepaper](https://iohk.io/research/papers/a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/)
which is a worthy read for anyone with background in cryptocurrency
theory. The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting
electricity on cracking computationally-heavy problem, a node gets
selected to mint a new block, proportionally to the amount of the value
a particular node has. A node that attempts to generate a block is
called "a stakeholder". You can read more about this process in [Proof
of Stake in Cardano SL]().

## Beyond Settlement Layer

[//]: # (<2017-02-20>)

Cardano SL is a "Layer" for a reason. It's the first component of
Cardano Platform. Eventually it will be expanded with Control Layer,
which will serve as trusted computation framework to evaluate special
kind of proofs that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In
gaming and gambling, such system can be useful for verifying honesty of
random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with [side
chains]() it will allow to accomplish such things as provably fair
distribution of winnings in games. The application of Control Layer lies
well beyond gaming and gambling applications. Identity management,
credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also
aiming to grow Cardano SL wallet program called [Daedalus]() into a
universal cryptocurrency wallet with automated cryptocurrency trading
and even cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.

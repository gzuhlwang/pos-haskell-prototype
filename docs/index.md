Cardano SL (SL stands for "Settlement Layer") is a cryptographic
currency designed and developed by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/team). You can
think of this product as of Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix
design flaws of Bitcoin. For those
who don't know what Bitcoin is, in the [next
section](#cryptocurrency-basics) we'll talk a little
bit about what a cryptocurrency is and why do cryptocurrencies matter.
If you have basic understanding of Bitcoin, you may

section. If you're eager to start working with Cardano SL, refer to
[Installation Guide]() and [Wallet Operation Guide]() to get started.

## Cryptocurrency Basics

[//]: # (@any)

Before giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let's first talk about
why do we care about digital currencies in general and cryptographic
currencies in particular. 

### Why Do We Care?

#### Speed

As opposed to conventional (also called fiat), centrally banked
currencies such as Yen or American Dollar, digital currencies don't
require banking system to move value. Lack of this requirement means
that work with digital currencies is way faster than work with banking,
especially on the global scale. If we want to send ten Dollars from
Osaka to Denver using a digital currency, we won't have to wait for days
for the value to get transferred. In fact, there is no distinction
between sending value to your neighbour or to a friend on the other
side of the globe, the transfer will follow the same
understandable rules within a predictable amount of time.

#### You Own Your Money

With banking system, all that an owner of a bank account has is a
promise of a commercial bank to pay the person a certain amount of money
within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a payout request. Of
course, banks also have limits to such transactions, so nobody can "cash
out" quickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a
special kind of information, called _a secret key_ can spend the money
at will. No other entity has a power to manipulate value that a user
has.

#### Pseudonymity

One can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they like, receiving
and spending money from different addresses in different ways. A
merchant running an E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses to
receive money and issue refunds and a personal "wallet" for their own
needs. All of this is controlled from one interface and there is no need
to log in to several payment platforms, suffering an overhead.

### Security

Your money are as secure as the _secret key_ that allows spending those.
That means that storing your secret key in a safe on a laptop
disconnected from the Internet is equivalent of having banknotes in a
password-protected lock-box in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this
money even by carrying out a successful cyber-attack.

### Extensibility

Using an approach known as "side chains", general-purpose
cryptocurrencies (such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin) can "fuel"
domain-specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way,
whatever innovative thing is developed via a domain-specific
cryptocurrency, anyone who holds value in a general-purpose
cryptocurrency can participate in. Examples of such applications are
identity management, gaming and gambling, verifiable computations.

### What is a Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to
manipulate value. Cryptography provides us with a way to generate a
proof that it was us who issued any kind of information. This is called
_digital signing_. In cryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database
which answers a question "which address has how much money") by signing
and sending transactions into the network and receiving blocks of
confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are normally decentralized,
which means that many people from all over the globe participate in
ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Obviously, a
consensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most
significant approaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the
next section.

## What Makes Cardano SL Special?

[//]: # (v0.1.0.0)

There are a lot of similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano
SL, but also there are quite some differences between those two
cryptocurrencies. Most significant difference between Bitcoin and
Cardano SL is that Bitcoin is a Proof of Work type cryptocurrency, while
Cardano SL makes use of a Proof of Stake approach to consensus.
